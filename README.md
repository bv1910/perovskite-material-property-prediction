# perovskite-material-property-prediction
Comparative analysis of regression models for double perovskite property prediction using LazyPredict and classification into conductors, semiconductors & insulators.

# Double Perovskite Material Property Prediction

**Project Overview** : 
This project performs a comprehensive comparative analysis of 30 regression models using LazyPredict to predict material properties of double perovskite compounds.

It also includes classification of the compounds into:
- **Conductors**
- **Semiconductors**
- **Insulators**

## Objectives
- Evaluate performance of multiple regression models
- Identify the best performing model
- Analyze structural features of double perovskites
- Categorize compounds based on predicted properties


##  Key Findings
- **Histogram Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the best performance**
- Most perovskite compounds behave as semiconductors or insulators
- Conductive perovskite compounds are rare
- Predicted the possible applications of these perovskites
- Prediction of colour when sunlight affects these compounds

##  Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- LazyPredict
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy
